gary gremillion bruce adam civil service commission norvel orazio michael glasser harry mendoza bruce little william ceravolo simon hargrove city of new orleans james scott frederick morton and raymond burkart jr no 7992 versus department of police i application of civil service rule iv sec 1.4 this proceeding wa brought by named complainant who with the exception of major raymond burkart jr. are employed by the new orleans police department appointing authority a police captain the complainant contend that the commission should grant to those assigned to the position of integrity control officer ico a retroactive ten percent 10 salary adjustment pursuant to civil service rule iv sec 1.4 which provides a follows if for one class of position two or more rate of pay are established to reflect equitably the difference in the unpleasant or dangerous aspect of various assignment made in the class of position change in assignment shall result in corresponding salary adjustment such salary adjustment shall not be considered either a pay increase or pay reduction but must be reported to the director the complainant argue that because they perform essentially the same function a police officer assigned to the public integrity bureau pib they are entitled to the same ten percent pay adjustment received by all police officer assigned to pib they contend that the ten percent pay adjustment serf to attract and reward police officer who are assigned unpleasant task complainant rely upon the appointing authority s justification for the pay adjustment a articulated during a february 16 1995 meeting of the commission when the public integrity division now bureau wa originally created identified a complainant no 14 october 31 3012 transcript page and attached to pl memo exhibit a 2,3 g. gremillion et al 7992 a reflected in the minute of the commission meeting the ten percent salary adjustment wa granted at the appointing authority s request after representation made by then superintendent of police richard pennington that salary incentive are essential when one group of police officer are required to investigate brother officer and the recommended pay incentive would ably assist the public integrity division in attracting the best and most dedicated officer to become part of the division voluntarily. it doe appear from the minute entry that the appointing authority persuaded the commission to approve the pay increase a an incentive to attract police officer to an otherwise undesirable position that included unpleasant task i.e the requirement to investigate fellow police officer further the appointing authority provided no alternative explanation for why those officer assigned to pib would receive additional pay a we interpret our civil service rule iv sec 1.4 if one class of employee receives additional pay because of the unpleasant nature of their work assignment in this case pib employee change in assignment for other employee to the same unpleasant work assignment justify and require that those employee receive the additional pay thus if in fact the record establishes that the ico s are performing the same task a those assigned to pib they are entitled to the same salary adjustment i work assignment of integrity control officer most of the material fact are not in dispute or were otherwise clearly established by the complainant through fob policy 8 revised april 12 2011 the appointing authority redefined the position of integrity control officer prior to the revision ico s were police lieutenant assigned to the various police district if an ico through the course of his or her assignment observed or wa informed of a violation of internal rule by a police officer assigned the ico s district the ico would report the violation to pib who would either investigate the violation internally or assign the investigation to the district where the violation occurred the ico would not conduct the internal 3,4 g. gremillion et al 7992 investigation but would give the investigation to a subordinate usually a police sergeant assigned to the district the assignment were rotated between sergeant based upon case load and experience a a consequence no individual spent all or most of their time conducting internal investigation unless they were assigned to pib the complainant provided exhaustive unrefuted testimony supported by reliable evidence that they spend a vast majority of their time conducting internal investigation in fact the complainant provided ample evidence that they actually conduct more internal investigation than those individual assigned to pib they are not assigned to a district and they are prohibited from assigning their investigation to subordinate further regardless of the seriousness of the charge the complainant are prohibited from giving the investigation back to pib while acknowledging that the ico s conduct more investigation than those individual assigned to pib the appointing authority contends that the complainant investigate le serious allegation that those individual assigned to pib the appointing authority also contends that the complainant have other duty that do not involve investigating other police officer hil conclusion we find that the complainant are entitled to the ten percent pay differential pursuant to civil service rule iv sec 1.4 by concentrating all internal investigation that were once spread throughout the district and bureau into the hand of a few individual the appointing authority ha created a job assignment that is indistinguishable from those function performed by pib while it may be argued by the appointing authority that pib investigates more serious allegation any investigation that may result in some disciplinary action is an investigation of a fellow police officer which wa the initial justification that allowed for the pay incentive in the first place 4,5 g. gremillion et al 7992 accordingly the appointing authority is ordered to pay the ten percent pay differential a part of the salary of those individual that have performed the assignment of integrity control officer

officer to his supervisor or directly to pib for review and investigation. h.e exh 1 thus nopd s own policy appears to intentionally remove the responsibility of investigating allegation of nopd officer/employee misconduct from non-supervisory nopd officers/employees app exh 1 a shown by the following exchange between nopd s 5,6 l. jones no 8482 counsel and the pib investigator charged with investigating appellant s alleged misconduct appellant complied with the letter of the nopd policy identified in the disciplinary letter q so your investigation found that the only person appellant reported the allegation of officer misconduct to wa his supervisor sergeant burke when they met a that s correct tr at based upon the foregoing the commission find that nopd ha failed to establish that appellant violated nopd policy 1020.5.1 2 civil service rule ix 11 given that appellant s conduct wa consistent with nopd policy 1020.5.1 a it pertains to reporting allegation of nopd officer/employee misconduct the commission must turn to whether or not appellant s action or lack thereof with respect to the female subject s complaint of sexual assault constituted an omission of an act appellant had a duty to perform nopd take the position that appellant should have notified both his supervisor and the sex crime unit regarding the female subject s allegation commander otha sandifer conducted the disciplinary hearing related to the allegation against appellant and testified that la|ny time a sexual allegation is made sex crime is notified whether or not the alleged perpetrator is a police officer or not tr at appellant did not offer any contradictory testimony with respect to commander sandifer s assertion a a result of commander sandifer s testimony and appellant s failure to notify the sex crime unit of the female subject s allegation of sexual assault the commission find that appellant objected to any line of questioning pertaining to appellant s failure to notify the sex crime unit of the allegation of sexual assault made by the female subject while the hearing examiner sustained some of these objection the commission find that the line of questioning wa appropriate given that nopd relied upon both it own policy and the commission s rule 6,7 l. jones no 8482 nopd ha satisfied it burden in establishing that appellant failed to perform a function it wa his duty to perform namely reporting any sexual assault directly to the sex crimes/sexual assault unit b adverse impact on efficient operation of appointing authority nopd alleges that had appellant notified the sexual assault unit specialized investigator could have become involved and determined whether or not this alleged sexual assault actually occurred however because appellant failed to take a more active posture in connection with the allegation nopd lost an opportunity to better as the veracity of the female subject s allegation the commission agrees allegation of sexual assault are among the most serious fielded by nopd regardless of whether or not an officer belief a particular complainant he or she ha an obligation to investigate allegation to the best of his/her ability in the matter now before the commission appellant need only to have made the sex crime unit aware of the allegation of sexual assault pursuant to standard operating procedure the commission find that when officer fail to notify the sex crime unit of allegation of sex crime the effectiveness and efficiency of this specialized unit is diminished c. discipline commensurate with offense in conducting it analysis the commission must determine if the appellant s letter of reprimand wa commensurate with the dereliction otherwise the discipline would be arbitrary and capricious. waguespack

appellant are under an enormous amount of pressure and must often triage certain complaint in the matter now before the commission it is possible that appellant did not believe the female complainant s claim nevertheless he should have processed the allegation of sexual assault a he would have any other similar allegation for reason known only to appellant he failed to do so the fact that appellant notified his supervisor mitigates his omission to a certain extent but doe not excuse appellant from performing his duty a written reprimand is the lowest level of discipline available to appointing authority and the commission find that nopd s issuance of a written reprimand in this instance wa an appropriate correctional action in it attempt to maintain a high level of performance vv

secondly we find that the appointing authority ha proven that appellant neglected her duty in not forwarding the call transcribed in exhibit d e f l and j each of those call involved complaint about possible criminal activity which might require a response from the police thirdly a to the call transcribed in exhibit g and h we do not think that the appointing authority ha sufficiently proven a

arresting officer found marijuana on him and did not charge him an internal investigation resulted and the appellant wa found to have violated the department s internal rule the appellant wa disciplined and this appeal resulted analysis two distinct issue are presented in this appeal the first is the application of lsa-r.s the police officer bill of right and whether the underlying investigation violated those right because it exceeded the statutory time limit of sixty day for an administrative matter there is no question that the underlying investigation exceeded the sixty day period the question is whether the investigation wa administrative or criminal in nature from the onset of the investigation an allegation of malfeasance wa at the core of the alleged action or lack of action by the appellant the appellant wa notified of the underlying rule violation that were being investigated and wa also notified of the investigator s finding and of the fact that a commander s hearing would be held all of these notification included the allegation that the appellant had committed malfeasance we find that the underlying investigation wa criminal in nature and that the sixty day time period did not apply the second issue is whether the appellant s action in overlooking what he believed to be marijuana found on the arrestee amounted to malfeasance malfeasance is nopd exhibit 11 administrative statement of jamal kendrick pib investigation 2012-0788 page 3 lsa-r.s 1 b 7 specifically provides nothing in this paragraph shall limit any investigation of alleged criminal

manner or 3 knowingly permit any other public officer or public employee under his authority to intentionally refuse or fail to perform any duty lawfully required of him or to perform any such duty in an unlawful manner b any duty lawfully required of a public officer or public employee when delegated by him to a public officer or public employee shall be deemed to be a lawful duty of such public officer or employee the delegation of such lawful duty shall not relieve the public officer or employee of his lawful duty the louisiana supreme court ha interpreted malfeasance in state v. perez 464 so.2d 737 741 la.1985 the louisiana supreme court stated the phrase in the statute upon which this opinion hinge is any duty lawfully required of him before a public official can be charged with malfeasance in office there must be a statute or provision of the law which delineates an affirmative duty upon the official state v. passman 391 so.2d 1140 la.1980 the duty must be expressly imposed by law upon the official because the official is entitled to know exactly what conduct is expected of him in his official capacity and what conduct will subject him to criminal charge the court also stated the district attorney and the trial judge swore in their oath of office to support the constitution and law of this state and to faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duty incumbent upon them a public official la const art 10 sec 30 both public official have a mandatory duty to conform to the standard of conduct required by that oath state v. melerine 236 la 881 109 so.2d 454 1954 when the defendant swore to uphold the law of louisiana this oath imposed a specific duty upon them not to obstruct or interfere with the execution of those law to intentionally

sergeant joseph scanio appealed a written reprimand issued to him for failure to call back a complainant who had been waiting for an nopd response to her 911 call for over an hour the commission originally sustained the appeal and overturned the decision based upon a finding that nopd s investigation failed to comply with r.s colloquially known a the police officer s bill of rights. specifically the commission held that the investigation wa not completed in a timely manner i.e. within the 120 day provided for after an extension because the notice of accused 1 set a tentative hearing date rather than a concrete one and 2 indicated that such a hearing would be necessary if the allegation of misconduct were sustained in light of developing case law within the fourth circuit

146 so 3d 857 861 la ct. app 2014 il factual background appellant doe not dispute the one basic fact set forth in the disciplinary letter that he failed to call the complainant for over sixty minute and while most of the fact surrounding this matter are not in dispute we summarize them here in order to provide context for our decision appellant wa one of two sergeant assigned to the fifth district on june 7 2012 at p.m. on june 7th a female citizen made a 911 call indicating that her apartment had been broken into and that he perpetrator had killed one of her dog city exh 5 further she notified the 1,2 j. scanio case no 8193 dispatcher that she wa concerned that the perpetrator wa still in her apartment /d the complainant provided her information to the 911 call-taker and called back several time during the course of the afternoon to check on the status of her call approximately two-and-a-half hour after the complainant initiated her first call nopd officer arrived at her apartment and conducted an initial investigation city exh 5 nopd policy requires that the on duty district rank monitor the computer system that track incoming call fob policy 39 and if a call is holding sixty minute or more an on duty sergeant or the desk officer shall make contact with the complainant. jd the policy then provides a suggested script to use when speaking with a complainant who ha been waiting /d neither appellant nor the other sergeant on duty christina watson called the complainant back nor did they direct the desk officer to call. appellant asserted that he wa managing a variety of duty during his shift on june 7th wa doing his best to prioritize these duty see generally tr 78-82 appellant also stated that he did check on pending call throughout his shift by speaking with the desk officer but that the desk officer never informed him that there wa a call pending for more than an hour at one point in his shift appellant recalled that he overheard sergeant watson speaking with the desk officer regarding the backlog of call and made the assumption that all such call had been addressed tr at appellant did not identify any emergency or other pressing assignment that would have taken precedent over calling the complainant back or that would have prevented him from making such a call ww timeliness the police officer s bill of right governs the timing of investigation into alleged sergeant watson wa also issued a written letter of reprimand for her violation of nopd s policy regarding call back tr sergeant wilson did not appeal her discipline because she forgot. jd at i 7 2 2,3 j. scanio case no 8193 misconduct by a police officer when a formal written complaint is made against any police employee or law enforcement officer the superintendent of state police or the chief of police or his authorized representative shall initiate an investigation within fourteen day of the date the complaint is made except a otherwise provided in this paragraph each investigation of a police employee or law enforcement officer which is conducted under the provision of this chapter shall be completed within sixty day however in each municipality which is subject to a municipal fire and police civil service law the municipal police department may petition the municipal fire and police civil service board for an extension of the time within which to complete the investigation f the board find that the municipal police department ha shown good cause for the granting of an extension of time within which to complete the investigation the board shall grant an extension of up to sixty davs the investigation shall be considered complete upon notice to the police employee or law_enforcement officer under investigation of a pre-disciplinary_ hearing or_a determination of an unfounded or unsustained complaint r.s b 7 emphasis added thus the question of whether or not an investigation wa completed in a timely manner turn on two question 1 when did the investigation start 2 when did the investigation end in abbott the fourth circuit held that nopd s di-1 form constitutes the formal written complaint referenced by r.s and that the date nopd initiate a di-1 form signai s the initiation of an investigation. abboft at 202-203 in doing so the fourth circuit explicitly rejected the proposition that an investigation begin when the appointing authority engages in a systematic inquiry. jd citing nunnery v. city of bossier 822 f.supp.2d 620 632 w.d.la.2011 the completion of the investigation is defined by statute a occurring upon notice to the police employee or law enforcement officer under investigation of a pre-disciplinary hearing or a determination of an unfounded or unsustained complaint. /d at 203 citing r.s b 7 3,4 j. scanio case no 8193 in abbot a december 2011 notice to accused sent to each of the appellant in that case constituted the conclusion of the investigation since it 1 informed them that the complaint wa sustained 2 that the investigation wa complete and 3 provided a hearing date /d at 205 in the matter now before the commission the di-1 form wa completed on june 11 2012 and the notice of accused to appellant indicates that the investigation wa initiated on june 8 2012. city exh 1 on july 3 2012 the appointing authority requested and wa granted an extension of time in which to complete it investigation city exh 2 on october 1 2012 the appointing authority issued the appellant a notice to accused that wa received by the appellant on october 4 2012 city exh 3 this notice indicated that the investigation wa complete that the investigator wa recommending that the allegation against appellant be sustained and that a disciplinary hearing wa scheduled for december 5 2012 the content of the notice of accused issued to sergeant scanio are virtually identical in nature and content to the notice received by the officer in abdot in abbott the officer argued that their notice were deficient because of conditional language contained therein and that the notice only indicated the investigator 's recommended disposition not the final disposition /d at 204 the fourth circuit rejected the officer contention and held that the notice were sufficient to provide meaningful notice that the charge against them had been sustained and that a pre- disciplinary hearing had been scheduled in compliance with la r.s b 7 /d at 205 see also hurst v. dep't of police 2014-0119 la app 4 cir 146 so 3d 857 861 la ct. app 2014 based upon the fact of the instant appeal and in consideration of the holding in abbot and hurst the investigation into the appellant s misconduct began on june 8 2012 bearing in mind the extension granted by the commission nopd had until october 6 2012 to issue 4,5 j. scanio case no 8193 appellant a notice to accused nopd s issued such a notice within the prescribed timeline and that notice contained the required element signaling an end to the investigation therefore nopd s investigation complied with the timeline established by r.s iv cause for discipline given that the commission find that the discipline issued to appellant wa not procedurally deficient we now turn our attention to whether or not nopd ha met it burden in establishing that there wa sufficient cause to discipline appellant in a civil service disciplinary action the appointing authority ha the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence 1 the occurrence of the complained of activity and 2 that the conduct complained of impaired the efficiency of the

violated nopd policy there is no doubt that sergeant in the nopd have an enormous amount of responsibility and make a variety of critical decision on a daily basis all while supervising officer in the field and completing necessary administrative matter see generally tr at 78-82 and while the appellant offered several mitigating reason for his failure to provide the complainant with a callback the following fact are not in dispute 1 nopd policy requires the ranking officer on duty monitor call that are coming in and arrange for call to complainant who have been waiting for an nopd response for more than an hour fob policy 9 2 appellant wa aware of this policy tr appellant wa one of two ranking officer assigned to duty at the fifth district on june 7 2012 tr at l 4 there wa a call to 911 on june 7 2012 assigned to the fifth district city exh 4 5,6 j. scanio case no 8193 5 appellant along with two other nopd staff member were responsible for ensuring that the complainant received a call back tr 6 no call back wa made city exh 4 tr given the above undisputed fact nopd ha met it burden in establishing that appellant engaged in the conduct that led to his discipline the fact that no one told appellant that there wa a call pending for more than an hour doe not absolve appellant of liability for violating nopd s policy given that policy requires the ranking officer to monitor the pending call fob policy 39 ultimately the supervisor bear the responsibility to initiate call back 2 appellant s conduct impaired the efficiency of nopd commander christopher goodly described how the appellant s conduct impaired the efficiency of the department in the following manner although it 's a minor infraction fob policy 39 in my opinion wa created to provide the citizenry with a more customer service atmosphere the nature of our police work we sometimes through supervisory management we have to prioritize thing and in essence based on resource or the resource available you may have time where certain incident are waiting for action for an excessive amount of time when those thing persists according to fob policy 39 past sixty minute then it 's incumbent upon the field supervisor to just make sure it provides the citizenry with an update a continued update to let them know what the situation is and it actually make for a more customer service friendly atmosphere with the citizenry to let them know that we care to let them know that we are taking their call serious tr at appellant failed to mount an serious challenge to commander goodly s testimony and the commission accepts it 6,7 j. scanio case no 8193 v. conclusion based upon the above finding of fact and law nopd s investigation into appellant s misconduct adhered to the procedural requirement of louisiana revised statute furthermore nopd ha established by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant engaged in the conduct of which he stood accused and that such conduct impaired the operation of nopd thus the letter of reprimand received by appellant wa in accordance with this commission s rule the commission relied upon the entire record before it including the transcript from

the public service in which the employee is engaged asst supt darryl albert testified that he conducted the pre-disciplinary hearing and recommended disciplinary action to the appointing authority asst supt albert stated that he relied upon the appointing authority s disciplinary guideline when making his recommendation and that the action recommended were within those guideline he also explained that the rule prohibiting cash payment for detail wa promulgated to assure that all payment were property documented and to deter circumvention of the policy regarding paid detail according to asst supt albert cash payment are more difficult to track and link to the individual that actually performed the work the appellant contend that receiving check made payable to cash is distinguishable from actually receiving currency a payment for a detail they contend 4,5 d. abbott 8052 j. neyrey r. smith 8061 a. palumbo that a check made payable to cash provides a sufficient paper

the appellant contend that when the appointing authority sent an email on september 7 2011 to the appellant with specific question related to compliance with general order 828 an investigation began for purpose of la r.s by 7 asa consequence they argue that the investigation began prior to the issuance of the di-i s which were initiated on october 21 2012 according to the appellant if no extension request were made by the appointing authority until november 2 2012 the request were more than thirty day past the initiation of an investigation and thus violative of civil service rule allowing for an additional sixty day to investigate however la r.s b 7 reference a formal and written complaint made against a law enforcement officer a the starting point of an investigation for purpose of the statute initial inquires by email regarding compliance with a rule is not a formal investigation the purpose of the inquiry wa to determine whether a formal 4 5,6 d. abbott 8052 j. neyrey r. smith 8061 a palumbo investigation wa warranted the appointing authority a required by the statute initiated a di-1 which is a formal investigation once it determined that an investigation wa necessary based upon the di-1 initiation date the november 2 2012 request for extension of time were within thirty day of the initiation of the investigation and thus compliant with civil service rule 2 close of the investigation the appellant further contend that the notice to accused law enforcement officer under investigation of a pre-disciplinary hearing or a determination of an unfounded or unsustained complaint received by the appellant on june 27 2011 doe not meet the requirement of cleveland bd of educ v. loudermill 470 u.s. 532 1985 because it doe not provide the appellant with sufficient notice and an opportunity to respond to all of the charge that may form the basis for disciplinary action the appellant also rely upon the recent fourth cireuit appellate decision mulvey v. dept of police 108 so 3d 891 la.app 4 cir where the court found that a notice that doe not timely alert an officer a to whether a disciplinary hearing is definitely required is deficient dilatory and fails to sufficiently alert an officer of the status of his or her investigation. fd at 897 first appellant reliance on loudermill is misplaced loudermill applies to termination the appellant are appealing suspension where the notice requirement do not apply second mulvey is distinguishable in mulvey the notice received by the appellant provided no date for a pre-disciplinary hearing in the instant case the june 27 2011 notice provided an august 17 2011 disciplinary hearing date while the record 6,7 d. abbott 8052 j. neyrey r. smith 8061 a. palumbo suggests that the hearing did not occur
